Possible enhancements: 
 
 Add tool tips to describe fields and registers. 
 
 Move manual PITC download to a menu item. 
 
 Make register field control bigger. 
 
 Make INTERNAL version with all the registers. 
 
 Make command-line version that writes registers from an ini file. 
 
 Save registers to file for use in mfg tool. 



keygen generates key files for use by elftosb. (We need to get the OTP burner application to 
accept the key file format for burning the crypto key.)

	The key file format is very simple. It just has the hex version of a 128-bit key (so 32 hex characters),
	one key per line. The idea would be to load the key file and have a drop down menu to select which key
	to program. Most customers will probably only use a single key, though.

	The main thing is that it would be really nice for the customer if they could generate a set of keys 
	with keygen and use the same file for burning and elftosb. (creed)
