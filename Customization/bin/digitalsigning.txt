If you do not have the Sigmatel certificate in the Personal certificate store on your
system you must import it using pvkimprt.exe from this folder.

pvkimprt -IMPORT mycredentials.spc myprivatekey.pvk

password is "sigmatel"

Once in the "Personal" store you can sign an application with:

signcode /s my /cn "Sigmatel, Inc." <app name>
