STUMS - Sigmatel USB Mass Storage Drivers For Windows 98 SE

This driver was derived from a USBMSC sample template provided by Microsoft.
It is intended to provide USB Mass Storage support on Windows 98 SE.  Other
Micorsoft platforms provide native USBMSC support.

The driver has been modified to provide support for Sigmatel based devices.
Those changes will be listed here. In the event that Microsoft updates the
template, these changes will need to retained.
